////////////////////NOTE: I used vs code to edit, but compiled and ran everything in the MSYS2 MINGW64 TERMINAL.///////// OBVIOUSLY ALL
// REQUIRED LIBRARIES AND INSTALL FILES WERE PROPERLY PLACED "fREEGLUT", ETC. Screenshots of output and my local desktop terminal are given.

this is the course project it has libraries, executables, source code, glut headers, etc. click on the exe for the program, i personally used msys2 mingw64 terminal to compile and run everything, while using vs code to edit. i also have screenshots of the outputs and terminals for you to follow along just in case. thanks. 

//IGNORE THIS: note:if you want a fresh compile, amke sure to add vector3.cpp materialstuff.cpp, and objfile.cpp etc. along with the main file in the terminal command which is gtafailedheist.cpp.

I MADE THE BMP FILE THAT SHOWS DOWNTOWN OF CITY IN THE BACKGROUND. screen shots of output, and terminal included, etc.


//INSPIRED BY GTA VICE CITY VIDEO GAME, WHERE THERE IS A MISSION A BANK HEIST THAT KINDA GOES SOUTH AND A FEW PEOPLE DIE, TANKS, HELICOPTERS, SWAT, COPS, ETC ON THE SCENE. 

run the gtaFailedHeist.exe,


NEW FILE: 
for a fresh compile: g++ gtafailedheist.cpp material.cpp vector3.cpp objfile.cpp -o gta.exe etc.... -lfreeglut -lopengl32 -lglu32
